# DSA Journey

Welcome! This repository is where I document my daily progress while learning Data Structures and Algorithms.  
The goal is simple: stay consistent, learn deeply, and improve a little every single day.

I keep things minimal here — just short notes, quick reflections, and occasional code snippets as I move through different topics.  
Nothing fancy, just honest progress.

## What's inside?

- Daily practice notes
- Thought processes behind problems
- Mini dry-runs and intuition building
- Clean, beginner-friendly solutions once coding begins
- A growing collection of concepts I’m mastering along the way

## Why I’m doing this

To build the habit of thinking clearly, problem-solving better, and showing steady growth.  
This repo is more of a personal learning journal than a code dump.

## Notes format

Each day’s entry usually includes:
- **What I practiced**
- **What I learned**
- **One mistake I fixed**
- **Time spent**

(Just enough to track clarity — not overwhelm.)

## Tech

- Python (primarily)
- Markdown for notes
- Simple directory structure

## Final thoughts

If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by.  
This repo will keep growing as I do — one day at a time.
