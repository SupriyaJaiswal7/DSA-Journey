1️⃣ What did I understand today?

Today I learned the intuition behind the sliding window technique.
Sliding window is used when we work with a group of consecutive elements and those groups overlap.

Instead of recalculating everything again and again, sliding window helps reuse the previous work while moving forward.

2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?

The most important idea was that sliding window exists because of overlapping subproblems.
It helps reduce unnecessary repeated calculations.

I also learned that sliding window is a special case of the two pointers technique, where two pointers together represent a moving window.

3️⃣ One example that helped me understand

Finding the sum of consecutive numbers helped me understand sliding window.
When the window moves forward, one element is removed from the start and a new element is added at the end, instead of recalculating the whole sum.

4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed

At first, I thought sliding window avoids overlapping, but I realized that it is actually used because overlapping exists.
The technique helps handle overlapping efficiently, not remove it.

5️⃣ One sentence reflection

Today I learned that sliding window is a smart way to process consecutive elements efficiently by moving a window forward instead of starting from scratch.
