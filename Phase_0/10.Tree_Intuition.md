1️⃣ What did I understand today?

Today I learned the basic intuition behind trees.
A tree is a way of organizing data where elements are connected in a hierarchical manner instead of a straight line.

Unlike arrays or lists, trees branch out and show relationships like parent and child.

2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?

The most important idea was that a tree always starts from a single root.
From the root, data spreads into branches, and each element can have one or more children.

I also understood that trees help represent relationships naturally, rather than just order.

3️⃣ One example that helped me understand

Real-life examples like a family tree or a folder structure on a computer helped me understand trees.
A main folder contains subfolders, and those subfolders can contain more files or folders.

4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed

Earlier, I used to think trees were very complex structures.
Today I realized that the idea is simple — it is just data organized in levels instead of a straight sequence.

5️⃣ One sentence reflection

Today I learned that trees are a natural way to represent hierarchical relationships and are not as scary as they seem.
