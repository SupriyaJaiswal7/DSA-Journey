1️⃣ What did I understand today?

Today I learned what recursion really means.
Recursion is a way of solving a problem by trusting a smaller version of the same problem to solve itself.

Instead of solving everything at once, the problem is broken into smaller parts until it reaches a simple case that can be solved directly.

2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?

The most important idea was that every recursion needs a base case.
The base case stops the recursion and gives a direct answer.

I also understood that recursion works only when the problem size is reduced at each step, so that it eventually reaches the base case.

3️⃣ One example that helped me understand

A real-life example like asking people in a line about their position helped me understand recursion.
Each person does not know the full answer but trusts the next person to handle a smaller part of the same problem until the front of the line is reached.

4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed

Earlier, I thought recursion was just repeating the same thing again and again.
Today I realized that recursion is not blind repetition but a structured process with a clear stopping condition.

5️⃣ One sentence reflection

Today I learned that recursion becomes easier when I focus on the base case and trust the smaller problem to work correctly.
