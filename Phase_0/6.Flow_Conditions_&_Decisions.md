1️⃣ What did I understand today?

Today I learned about flow in problem solving.
Flow means the order in which decisions are made and actions are taken. In an algorithm, not all steps run every time. Only the steps whose conditions are true are executed.

I understood that flow decides which path the logic follows and which steps are skipped.

2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?

The most important idea was that conditions control decisions, and decisions control flow.
A condition by itself does nothing; it only decides what should happen next.

I also learned that once a condition is true, the remaining conditions are not checked. This helps avoid confusion and conflicting actions.

3️⃣ One example that helped me understand

Real-life examples like deciding what to wear based on weather helped me understand flow and conditions.
For example, if it is raining, I take an umbrella; if it is cloudy, I take a jacket; otherwise, I don’t take anything.

Only one decision is made, not all of them.

4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed

Earlier, I used to think that all conditions are checked one by one, even after a decision is made.
Today I realized that in branching logic, once a condition is satisfied, the rest are skipped.

5️⃣ One sentence reflection

Today I learned that clear flow and conditions are what make an algorithm predictable and correct.
