1️⃣ What did I understand today?

Today I learned what grouping really means in DSA.
Grouping is the process of putting similar things together so that they are easier to manage and understand.

I also learned that grouping is different from sorting. Sorting focuses on order, while grouping focuses on similarity.

2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?

The most important idea was that grouping helps reduce repeated work.
When similar items are grouped together, we don’t need to check the same thing again and again.

I also understood that grouping often leads to counting, where we keep track of how many times something appears.

3️⃣ One example that helped me understand

Grouping items like fruits or clothes helped me understand this concept.
For example, grouping the same type of clothes together and then counting how many of each type are there makes managing them easier.

4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed

Earlier, I thought grouping always required sorting.
Today I realized that grouping can work even without order, as long as similar items are kept together.

5️⃣ One sentence reflection

Today I learned that grouping is a simple but powerful idea that saves time and forms the foundation of counting problems in DSA.
