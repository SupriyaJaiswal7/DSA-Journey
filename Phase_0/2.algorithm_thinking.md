# Algorithm Thinking

Today I tried to understand how to think about a problem before jumping into code.  
I realised that most of the time, I try to solve things directly, which makes the logic messy.  
So I practiced breaking problems into a simple 5-step structure that helps me think more clearly.

## The 5-step method I followed

I’m writing these steps in my own words because it helped me understand better.

### 1. Restate  
Say the problem again in the simplest language possible.  
If I can’t explain it simply, I don’t actually understand it.

### 2. Observe  
Look for what the problem is *really* asking.  
Here I try to notice patterns, required operations, or comparisons.

### 3. Brute force idea  
Think of the slowest but most obvious solution.  
This step removes fear because once I have something basic, I don’t feel stuck.

### 4. Optimized idea  
Now I try to make the idea cleaner or faster.  
This does not mean “write code” — just refine the thought process.

### 5. Dry run  
Take a small example and walk through the logic like I’m explaining it to someone.  
This makes mistakes visible instantly.

## What I practiced today

I worked on simple problems like:
- finding the largest among three numbers  
- deciding which number is closer to a target (like 10)  
- comparing distance from 0 and 100  

While doing this, I noticed that the 5-step structure forced me to slow down and explain to myself what’s happening.

## A small solved example

**Problem:**  
Given two numbers, say 8 and 14, decide which one is closer to 10.

**1. Restate:**  
We need to check which number sits nearer to 10.

**2. Observe:**  
Closeness depends on the distance from 10.

**3. Brute force idea:**  
Calculate (10 - number) for both and compare.

**4. Optimized idea:**  
Use absolute difference:  
- |10 - 8| = 2  
- |14 - 10| = 4  

The smaller difference means closer.

**5. Dry run:**  
8 is 2 units away, 14 is 4 units away → **8 is closer**.

This small example reminded me how clean a solution becomes when I follow the steps properly.

## A mistake I caught in myself

My first instinct is to start writing `if` statements directly.  
That means my brain jumps into coding mode too early.

I want to fix that habit by always completing the 5 steps before touching any code.

## A small improvement from today

When writing explanations, I’m learning to keep them short and clean instead of emotional or confusing.  
Saying something like:

“compare distance and pick the smaller one”

is so much better than overthinking the explanation.

It already feels easier.

## If you want to practice too

Here are a few small questions someone else (or future me) can try using the same 5-step method.  
Try to spend around **3–4 minutes** per problem, not more — the goal is clarity, not speed.

1. Given two numbers, find which one is closer to 50.  
2. You have three numbers — decide which one is the smallest.  
3. Check if a number is closer to 0 or 20.  
4. Given two numbers, decide which one is farther from 10.  
5. Compare two integers and determine if they are equally close to a target or one is closer.

These are all simple, but they help train the thinking structure.
