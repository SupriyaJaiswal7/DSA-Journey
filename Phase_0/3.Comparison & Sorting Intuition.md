1️⃣ What did I understand today?
Today I learned about comparison and sorting, and the relationship between them.
Comparison is the process of checking two elements to understand their relationship, such as which number is bigger, smaller, or whether they are equal.


2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?
Sorting means arranging elements in a specific order, like increasing or decreasing order.
Without comparison, sorting and searching are not possible.
I didn’t learn anything completely new today, but I did learn a new way to look at things.
Earlier, I never thought deeply about how comparison is the base of sorting and searching. Seeing this connection made the concepts feel more structured.


3️⃣ One example that helped me understand
Arranging a list helped me understand how comparison is used again and again to put elements in order.


4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed
Since this topic is foundational, I didn’t feel much confusion. Going through it slowly helped reinforce the basics clearly.


5️⃣ One sentence reflection
This topic felt basic, but revising it helped me understand why comparison and sorting are so important in DSA.
