1️⃣ What did I understand today?

Today I learned what searching really means in DSA.
Searching is the process of finding whether an element exists, and if it does, where it exists.

I also understood that searching does not require the data to be sorted. Sorting only helps make searching faster, but searching itself can be done even on unsorted data.

2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?

The most important idea for me was that linear search exists for a reason.
Even though it checks elements one by one, it is useful when data is unsorted, small, or when we need to search only once.

I also learned that faster algorithms are not always the best choice. The best algorithm depends on the situation, not just speed.

3️⃣ One example that helped me understand

Searching for something like earrings or an object in garbage helped me understand linear search.
Since nothing is arranged, the only way is to look through things one by one.

4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed

Earlier, I used to think that faster algorithms should always be preferred.
Today I realized that preparing data (like sorting) can sometimes take more time than the search itself.

5️⃣ One sentence reflection

Today I learned that choosing the right algorithm depends on context, not just on how fast it looks.
