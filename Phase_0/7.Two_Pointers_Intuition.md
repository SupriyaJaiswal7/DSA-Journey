1️⃣ What did I understand today?

Today I learned the basic idea behind the two pointers approach.
Two pointers means using two positions at the same time to process data instead of using only one.

Instead of checking everything repeatedly, we move two pointers in a controlled way to solve the problem more efficiently.

2️⃣ What idea felt important or new?

The important idea was that two pointers help reduce unnecessary work.
By moving pointers based on conditions, we can avoid checking the same elements again and again.

I also understood that the two pointers method depends a lot on flow and conditions, because the movement of pointers is decided by comparisons.

3️⃣ One example that helped me understand

An example like checking elements from both ends of a list helped me understand two pointers.
For example, when comparing elements from the start and the end at the same time, we can make decisions faster than checking everything one by one.

4️⃣ One mistake or confusion I noticed

Earlier, I used to think that problems must always be solved using a single loop or single direction.
Today I realized that using two pointers together can make the logic simpler and more efficient.

5️⃣ One sentence reflection

Today I learned that using two pointers is a smarter way to control flow and comparisons without repeating unnecessary work.
