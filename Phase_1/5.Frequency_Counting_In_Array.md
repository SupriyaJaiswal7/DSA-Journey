🔹 What is Frequency Counting?

Frequency counting means counting how many times each element appears in an array.

Example:

Array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Frequencies:
1 → 3 times
2 → 2 times
3 → 1 time


This technique is useful when:

Finding duplicates

Counting occurrences

Solving grouping problems

🔹 Basic Approach (Using a Dictionary)

We use a dictionary because:

Keys store the element

Values store the count

🔹 Frequency Counting Logic

Steps:

Start with an empty dictionary

Traverse the array

If element exists → increase count

If not → add it with count 1

🔹 Code Example
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]

freq = {}

for x in arr:
    if x in freq:
        freq[x] += 1
    else:
        freq[x] = 1

print(freq)


Output:

{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}

🔹 Correctness Explanation

Why this works:
This works because every element is processed once and its count is updated correctly in the dictionary.

🔹 Alternative Shorter Version
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]

freq = {}

for x in arr:
    freq[x] = freq.get(x, 0) + 1

print(freq)


This does the same thing but with cleaner syntax.

🔹 Finding Frequency of a Specific Element
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
freq = {}

for x in arr:
    freq[x] = freq.get(x, 0) + 1

print(freq[1])   # frequency of 1
