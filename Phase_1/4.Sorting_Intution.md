🔹 What is Sorting?

Sorting means arranging elements in a particular order, usually:

Ascending (small → large)

Descending (large → small)

Example:

Before sorting: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
After sorting:  [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]


Sorting makes many problems easier, especially searching and comparison-based tasks.

🔹 Why Do We Sort?

Sorting helps to:

Quickly find minimum or maximum values

Apply binary search

Detect duplicates easily

Solve problems using two pointers

Sorting itself is not always the goal — often it is a preprocessing step.

🔹 Sorting in Python (Built-in Way)
Using sort()
arr = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
arr.sort()
print(arr)


Sorts the array in ascending order

Modifies the original array (in-place)

Sorting in Descending Order
arr = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
arr.sort(reverse=True)
print(arr)

Using sorted()
arr = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
new_arr = sorted(arr)
print(new_arr)


Returns a new sorted array

Original array remains unchanged
