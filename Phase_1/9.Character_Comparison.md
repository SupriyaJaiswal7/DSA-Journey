 Character Comparison in Strings  

Most string problems are not about words.  
They are about characters.

To solve string problems properly, the string must be treated as a sequence of individual characters, each of which can be checked, compared, or counted.

Example:
"education"  
→ e d u c a t i o n

### Traversing a String
A string can be traversed just like an array.

s = "hello"

for ch in s:
    print(ch)
In this loop, ch holds one character at a time from the string.

Problem Statement
Given a string, count the number of vowels present in it.

Vowels:
a, e, i, o, u

Example:

Input: "education"
Output: 5

### Thought Process
To count vowels:
Start with a counter set to zero
Traverse the string character by character
Check whether the current character is a vowel
If yes, increment the counter
This approach ensures that no character is skipped.

### Basic Implementation
s = "education"
count = 0

for ch in s:
    if ch in "aeiou":
        count += 1

print(count)


### Why This Algorithm Works
-The algorithm works because each character in the string is examined exactly once, and the counter is increased only when the character satisfies the vowel condition.

### Handling Case Sensitivity
-Character comparison in strings is case-sensitive.
-This means uppercase vowels will not be counted unless handled explicitly.
-A simple fix is to convert the string to lowercase before processing.


s = "Education"
count = 0

for ch in s.lower():
    if ch in "aeiou":
        count += 1

print(count)


- Using a Set for Clearer Logic
- Using a set makes the intent of the code clearer and improves readability.


vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
s = "education"
count = 0

for ch in s:
    if ch in vowels:
        count += 1

print(count)


### Key Observations
-Strings are iterable, just like arrays
-Character comparison depends on case
-Membership checks using in simplify logic
-Every character must be evaluated independently


### Common Mistakes
-Forgetting to handle uppercase characters
-Confusing characters with substrings
-Placing the output statement inside the loop
-Skipping the correctness explanation


### What I Learned
-String problems require character-level thinking
-Simple conditions control complex outcomes
-Clean traversal logic leads to correct solutions
