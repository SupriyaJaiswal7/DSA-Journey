🔹 What is an Array?

An array is a collection of elements stored one after another in memory.
Each element can be accessed using its index, which always starts from 0.

Example:

Index:   0   1   2   3   4
Array:  [5,  2,  9,  1,  7]


Using the index, we can directly access any element in the array.

🔹 Accessing Elements

To access an element in an array, we use:

arr[index]


First element → arr[0]

Last element → arr[len(arr) - 1]

🔹 Printing All Elements of an Array

To print all elements, we loop through the array from the first index to the last.

arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]

for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i])


Why this works:
This works because the loop goes through every valid index of the array exactly once.

🔹 Finding the Maximum Element

To find the maximum element:

Assume the first element is the maximum.

Compare it with every other element.

Update the maximum whenever a larger value is found.

arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]

max_val = arr[0]

for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    if arr[i] > max_val:
        max_val = arr[i]

print(max_val)


Why this works:
This works because every element is compared with the current maximum, so the largest value cannot be missed.

🔹 Finding the Minimum Element

To find the minimum element:

Assume the first element is the minimum.

Compare it with the remaining elements.

Update the minimum whenever a smaller value is found.

arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]

min_val = arr[0]

for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    if arr[i] < min_val:
        min_val = arr[i]

print(min_val)


Why this works:
This works because every element is checked and the smallest value is updated whenever found.



🔹 Important Notes

- Initializing max/min with the first element is important, especially when the array contains negative values.

- If the array is empty, max/min logic will fail and must be handled separately.

- The same logic works for numbers, strings, and other comparable data types.



🔹 What I Learned Today

- Arrays allow fast access using indices.

- Traversing an array means visiting each element one by one.

- Problems like max and min are solved using simple comparisons.
