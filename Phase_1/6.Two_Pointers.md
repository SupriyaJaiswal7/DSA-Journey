The two pointers technique uses two indices to solve problems by moving them in a controlled way.
Instead of using one pointer that moves in one direction, we:
Start one pointer from the beginning
Start another pointer from the end
Move them towards each other
This is especially useful when working with arrays.


🔹 Why Two Pointers?

Two pointers help when:
We need to compare elements from both ends
We want to reverse or rearrange an array
We want to reduce extra space usage
It often replaces nested loops with a single loop.


🔹 Problem: Reverse an Array

Example:
Before: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After:  [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


🔹 Two Pointers Logic (Step-by-Step)

Set left pointer at index 0
Set right pointer at index len(arr) - 1
Swap elements at left and right
Move left forward and right backward
Stop when left >= right


🔹 Code Implementation

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
left = 0
right = len(arr) - 1

while left < right:
    arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
    left += 1
    right -= 1

print(arr)
