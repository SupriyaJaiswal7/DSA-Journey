🔹 Understanding Indexing

In an array, every element is stored at a fixed position called an index.
Indexing always starts from 0, not 1.

Example:

Index:   0   1   2   3
Array:  [4,  7,  1,  9]


Using the index, we can:

Read values

Update values

Traverse the array

🔹 Updating Elements in an Array

Arrays are mutable, meaning their values can be changed using the index.

arr = [4, 7, 1, 9]

arr[2] = 10   # updating value at index 2
print(arr)


Output:

[4, 7, 10, 9]


Here, only the value at index 2 is changed.
The rest of the array remains the same.

🔹 Traversing While Updating

We can update multiple elements by looping through the array.

Example: Multiply every element by 2.

arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]

for i in range(len(arr)):
    arr[i] = arr[i] * 2

print(arr)


Why this works:
This works because each index is visited once and updated directly using its position.

🔹 Sum of Elements in an Array

To find the sum of all elements:

Start with a variable total = 0

Add each element to total

Print the final sum

arr = [3, 5, 7, 2]

total = 0

for i in range(len(arr)):
    total += arr[i]

print(total)


Why this works:
This works because every element is added exactly once, so the final value of total is the sum of the entire array.

🔹 Alternative Way (Using Python Style)
arr = [3, 5, 7, 2]
total = sum(arr)
print(total)



🔹 Important Observations

Index-based access allows direct modification of elements.

Updating values does not change the size of the array.

Sum logic works for integers and floats.

If the array is empty, the sum is 0.

🔹 Common Mistakes

Using index out of range

Forgetting to initialize total

Confusing value with index

Skipping correctness explanation
