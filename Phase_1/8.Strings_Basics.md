🔹 What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters stored in order.
Examples:
"hello"
"data"
"DSA123"


In Python:
Strings are written inside quotes (" " or ' ')
Each character has an index, just like arrays
Indexing starts from 0

Example:
Index:   0   1   2   3   4
String:  h   e   l   l   o


🔹 Important Difference: Strings vs Arrays

Arrays (lists) are mutable → we can change elements
Strings are immutable → characters cannot be changed directly
This means:
s = "hello"
s[0] = "H"   #  Error


So when we want to modify a string, we usually:
Create a new string
Or convert it into a list


🔹 Problem: Reverse a String

Example:
Input:  "hello"
Output: "olleh"
This is similar to reversing an array, but we must respect immutability.


🔹 Method 1: Using Slicing (Pythonic Way)
s = "hello"
rev = s[::-1]
print(rev)
[::-1] means traverse the string from end to start


🔹 Method 2: Using Loop (Building New String)

Thought Process:
Start from the last character
Keep adding characters to a new string
s = "hello"
rev = ""

for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
    rev += s[i]

print(rev)
