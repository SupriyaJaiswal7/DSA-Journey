🔹 What is the Sliding Window Technique?

The sliding window technique is used when we want to look at a continuous part of an array (a subarray).
Instead of recalculating everything again and again, we:
Keep a window of elements
Slide it step by step
Update the result efficiently
This avoids unnecessary repeated work.


🔹 Why Do We Need Sliding Window?

Consider this problem:
Given an array, find the maximum sum of any subarray of size k.

Example:
Array: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]
k = 3


Possible subarrays:

[2, 1, 5] → sum = 8
[1, 5, 1] → sum = 7
[5, 1, 3] → sum = 9
[1, 3, 2] → sum = 6

Maximum sum = 9
A brute-force approach would calculate the sum again and again, which is slow.
Sliding window avoids this.


🔹 Key Idea Behind Sliding Window

Instead of recomputing the sum:
Add the new element entering the window
Remove the old element leaving the window
This way, the window “slides” forward without starting from scratch.


🔹 Fixed-Size Sliding Window

In this problem:
Window size k is fixed
The window always contains exactly k elements


🔹 Step-by-Step Thought Process

First, calculate the sum of the first k elements
Store it as the current window sum
Slide the window:
Add the next element
Subtract the element that goes out
Update the maximum sum if needed
Continue until the array ends


🔹 Code Implementation
arr = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]
k = 3

window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
max_sum = window_sum

for i in range(k, len(arr)):
    window_sum = window_sum + arr[i] - arr[i - k]
    max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

print(max_sum)


🔹 Dry Run (Very Important)

Initial window:
[2, 1, 5] → sum = 8
max_sum = 8


Slide window:
Add 1, remove 2 → [1, 5, 1] → sum = 7
Add 3, remove 1 → [5, 1, 3] → sum = 9
Add 2, remove 5 → [1, 3, 2] → sum = 6
Final answer = 9


🔹 Correctness Explanation

Why this works:
This works because the window always contains exactly k consecutive elements, and the sum is updated correctly as the window slides.
