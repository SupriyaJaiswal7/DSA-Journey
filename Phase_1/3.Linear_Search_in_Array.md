🔹 What is Searching?

Searching means checking whether a given element exists in an array.
If it exists, we usually return its index.
If it doesn’t, we report that it is not found.

Example:

Array:  [6, 3, 9, 2, 7]
Target: 9
Result: Found at index 2

🔹 Linear Search (Basic Idea)

In linear search:

Start from the first element

Compare each element with the target

Stop when the element is found or the array ends

This method is called linear because elements are checked one by one.

🔹 Linear Search Code
arr = [6, 3, 9, 2, 7]
target = 9

found = False

for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] == target:
        print("Found at index", i)
        found = True
        break

if not found:
    print("Not found")

🔹 Why We Use break

Once the element is found:

There is no need to continue searching

break stops the loop immediately

This avoids unnecessary comparisons.

🔹 Correctness Explanation

Why this works:
This works because each element of the array is compared with the target, so if the target exists, it will be found.

🔹 Searching Without Index (Existence Check)

Sometimes we only care whether the element exists, not its index.

arr = [6, 3, 9, 2, 7]
target = 4

exists = False

for x in arr:
    if x == target:
        exists = True
        break

print(exists)

🔹 Handling “Not Found” Case

It is important to handle the case when the target is not present.

Common ways:

Use a found flag

Print -1

Return False

Example:

if not found:
    print("Element not present")

🔹 Important Notes

Linear search works on unsorted arrays

No special preparation is needed

Simple but slower for large arrays

🔹 Common Mistakes

Forgetting to stop after finding the element

Printing “not found” inside the loop

Confusing index with value

Not handling empty arrays

🔹 What I Learned Today

Searching means checking for the presence of a value

Linear search compares elements one by one

Proper handling of the “not found” case is important.
